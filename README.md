We plan to create a very interesting demo by combining [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) and [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) which aims to detect and segment Anything with text inputs! And we will continue to improve it and create more interesting demos based on this foundation.

We are very willing to **help everyone share and promote new projects** based on Segment-Anything, Please checkout here for more amazing demos and works in the community: [Highlight Extension Projects](#bulb-highlight-extension-projects). You can submit a new issue (with `project` tag) or a new pull request to add new project's links. 

**üçÑ Why Building this Project?**

The **core idea** behind this project is to **combine the strengths of different models in order to build a very powerful pipeline for solving complex problems**. And it's worth mentioning that this is a workflow for combining strong expert models, where **all parts can be used separately or in combination, and can be replaced with any similar but different models (like replacing Grounding DINO with GLIP or other detectors / replacing Stable-Diffusion with ControlNet or GLIGEN/ Combining with ChatGPT)**.

**üçá Updates**
- **`2023/05/11`**: We decide to share more interesting demo with AIGC and  release some tested DeepFloyd demo and Notes in [inpaint_playground/DeepFloyd](./inpaint_playground/DeepFloyd/). And we're going to build a cleaner README for the users recently.
- **`2023/05/05`**: Release a simpler code for automatic labeling (combined with Tag2Text model): please see [automatic_label_simple_demo.py](./automatic_label_simple_demo.py)
- **`2023/05/03`**: Checkout the [Automated Dataset Annotation and Evaluation with GroundingDINO and SAM](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/automated-dataset-annotation-and-evaluation-with-grounding-dino-and-sam.ipynb) which is an amazing tutorial on automatic labeling! Thanks a lot for [Piotr Skalski](https://github.com/SkalskiP) and [Robotflow](https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks)!
- **`2023/05/02`**: Release a better python API for GroundingDINO (annotate image less than 20 lines of code): please see [grounding_dino_demo.py](./grounding_dino_demo.py)
- **`2023/05/02`**: Release a more simple and elegant code for Grounded-SAM demo: please see [grounded_sam_simple_demo.py](./grounded_sam_simple_demo.py)

## :golfing: Run Grounded-Segment-Anything + Inpainting Gradio APP
The following introduces the 6 task_type modes provided by Gradio APP:
1. **scribble**: Segmentation is achieved through Segment Anything and mouse click interaction (you need to click on the object with the mouse, no need to specify the prompt).
2. **automask**: Segment the entire image at once through Segment Anything (no need to specify a prompt).
3. **det**: Realize detection through Grounding DINO and text interaction (text prompt needs to be specified).
4. **seg**: Realize text interaction by combining Grounding DINO and Segment Anything to realize detection + segmentation (need to specify text prompt).
5. **inpainting**: By combining Grounding DINO + Segment Anything + Stable Diffusion to achieve text exchange and replace the target object (need to specify text prompt and inpaint prompt) .
6. **automatic**: By combining BLIP + Grounding DINO + Segment Anything to achieve non-interactive detection + segmentation (no need to specify prompt).

```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

- The gradio_app visualization as follow:

![](./assets/gradio_demo.png)


## :label: Run Grounded-Segment-Anything + Tag2Text Demo
Tag2Text achieves superior image tag recognition ability of [**3,429**](https://github.com/xinyu1205/Tag2Text/blob/main/data/tag_list.txt) commonly human-used categories.
It is seamlessly linked to generate pseudo labels automatically as follows:
1. Use Tag2Text to generate tags.
2. Use Grounded-Segment-Anything to generate the boxes and masks.

- Download the checkpoint for Tag2Text:
```bash
cd Tag2Text

wget https://huggingface.co/spaces/xinyu1205/Tag2Text/resolve/main/tag2text_swin_14m.pth
```

- Run Demo
```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python automatic_label_tag2text_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --tag2text_checkpoint ./Tag2Text/tag2text_swin_14m.pth \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \
  --input_image assets/demo9.jpg \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --box_threshold 0.25 \
  --text_threshold 0.2 \
  --iou_threshold 0.5 \
  --device "cuda"
```

- Tag2Text also provides powerful captioning capabilities, and the process with captions can refer to [BLIP](#robot-run-grounded-segment-anything--blip-demo).
- The pseudo labels and model prediction visualization will be saved in `output_dir` as follows (right figure):

![](./assets/automatic_label_output/demo9_tag2text.jpg)


## :robot: Run Grounded-Segment-Anything + BLIP Demo
It is easy to generate pseudo labels automatically as follows:
1. Use BLIP (or other caption models) to generate a caption.
2. Extract tags from the caption. We use ChatGPT to handle the potential complicated sentences. 
3. Use Grounded-Segment-Anything to generate the boxes and masks.

- Run Demo
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://closeai.deno.dev/v1
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python automatic_label_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \
  --input_image assets/demo3.jpg \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --openai_key $OPENAI_API_KEY \
  --box_threshold 0.25 \
  --text_threshold 0.2 \
  --iou_threshold 0.5 \
  --device "cuda"
```

- When you don't have a paid Account for ChatGPT is also possible to use NLTK instead. Just don't include the ```openai_key``` Parameter when starting the Demo.
  - The Script will automatically download the necessary NLTK Data.

## :open_mouth: Run Grounded-Segment-Anything + Whisper Demo
Detect and segment anything with speech!

**Install Whisper**
```bash
pip install -U openai-whisper
```
See the [whisper official page](https://github.com/openai/whisper#setup) if you have other questions for the installation.

**Run Voice-to-Label Demo**

Optional: Download the demo audio file

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/ShilongLiu/GroundingDINO/resolve/main/demo_audio.mp3
```


```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python grounded_sam_whisper_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \
  --input_image assets/demo4.jpg \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --box_threshold 0.3 \
  --text_threshold 0.25 \
  --speech_file "demo_audio.mp3" \
  --device "cuda"
```

**Run Voice-to-inpaint Demo**

You can enable chatgpt to help you automatically detect the object and inpainting order with `--enable_chatgpt`. 

Or you can specify the object you want to inpaint [stored in `args.det_speech_file`] and the text you want to inpaint with [stored in `args.inpaint_speech_file`].

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://closeai.deno.dev/v1
# Example: enable chatgpt
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python grounded_sam_whisper_inpainting_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \
  --input_image assets/inpaint_demo.jpg \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --box_threshold 0.3 \
  --text_threshold 0.25 \
  --prompt_speech_file assets/acoustics/prompt_speech_file.mp3 \
  --enable_chatgpt \
  --openai_key $OPENAI_API_KEY\
  --device "cuda"
```

```bash
# Example: without chatgpt
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python grounded_sam_whisper_inpainting_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \
  --input_image assets/inpaint_demo.jpg \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --box_threshold 0.3 \
  --text_threshold 0.25 \
  --det_speech_file "assets/acoustics/det_voice.mp3" \
  --inpaint_speech_file "assets/acoustics/inpaint_voice.mp3" \
  --device "cuda"
```

## :speech_balloon: Run ChatBot Demo
Following [Visual ChatGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt), we add a ChatBot for our project. Currently, it supports:
1. "Descripe the image."
2. "Detect the dog (and the cat) in the image."
3. "Segment anything in the image."
4. "Segment the dog (and the cat) in the image."
5. "Help me label the image."
6. "Replace the dog with a cat in the image."

To use the ChatBot:
- Install whisper if you want to use audio as input.
- Set the default model setting in the tool `Grounded_dino_sam_inpainting`.
- Run Demo
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://closeai.deno.dev/v1
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python chatbot.py 
```
