We plan to create a very interesting demo by combining [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) and [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) which aims to detect and segment Anything with text inputs! And we will continue to improve it and create more interesting demos based on this foundation.

We are very willing to **help everyone share and promote new projects** based on Segment-Anything, Please checkout here for more amazing demos and works in the community: [Highlight Extension Projects](#highlighted-projects). You can submit a new issue (with `project` tag) or a new pull request to add new project's links.

**üçÑ Why Building this Project?**

The **core idea** behind this project is to **combine the strengths of different models in order to build a very powerful pipeline for solving complex problems**. And it's worth mentioning that this is a workflow for combining strong expert models, where **all parts can be used separately or in combination, and can be replaced with any similar but different models (like replacing Grounding DINO with GLIP or other detectors / replacing Stable-Diffusion with ControlNet or GLIGEN/ Combining with ChatGPT)**.

**üçá Updates**
- **`2023/06/01`** Our Grounded-SAM has been accepted to present a **demo** at **ICCV 2023**! See you in Paris!

### :running_man: GroundingDINO: Detect Everything with Text Prompt

:grapes: [[arXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05499)] &nbsp; :rose:[[Try the Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/zero-shot-object-detection-with-grounding-dino.ipynb)] &nbsp; :sunflower: [[Try Huggingface Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ShilongLiu/Grounding_DINO_demo)] &nbsp; :mushroom: [[Automated Dataset Annotation and Evaluation](https://youtu.be/C4NqaRBz_Kw)]

Here's the step-by-step tutorial on running `GroundingDINO` demo:

**Step 1: Download the pretrained weights**

```bash
cd Grounded-Segment-Anything

# download the pretrained groundingdino-swin-tiny model
wget https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth
```

**Step 2: Running the demo**

```bash
python grounding_dino_demo.py
```

<details>
<summary> <b> Running with Python (same as demo but you can run it anywhere after installing GroundingDINO) </b> </summary>

```python
from groundingdino.util.inference import load_model, load_image, predict, annotate
import cv2

model = load_model("GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py", "./groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth")
IMAGE_PATH = "assets/demo1.jpg"
TEXT_PROMPT = "bear."
BOX_TRESHOLD = 0.35
TEXT_TRESHOLD = 0.25

image_source, image = load_image(IMAGE_PATH)

boxes, logits, phrases = predict(
    model=model,
    image=image,
    caption=TEXT_PROMPT,
    box_threshold=BOX_TRESHOLD,
    text_threshold=TEXT_TRESHOLD
)

annotated_frame = annotate(image_source=image_source, boxes=boxes, logits=logits, phrases=phrases)
cv2.imwrite("annotated_image.jpg", annotated_frame)
```

</details>
<br>

**Tips**
- If you want to detect multiple objects in one sentence with [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO), we suggest seperating each name with `.` . An example: `cat . dog . chair .`

**Step 3: Check the annotated image**

The annotated image will be saved as `./annotated_image.jpg`.

<div align="center">

| Text Prompt | Demo Image | Annotated Image |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| `Bear.` | ![](./assets/demo1.jpg)  | ![](./assets/annotated_image.jpg) |
| `Horse. Clouds. Grasses. Sky. Hill` | ![](./assets/demo7.jpg)  | ![](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex-storage/blob/main/assets/grounded_sam/grounding_dino/groundingdino_demo7.jpg?raw=true)

</div>


### :running_man: Grounded-SAM: Detect and Segment Everything with Text Prompt

Here's the step-by-step tutorial on running `Grounded-SAM` demo:

**Step 1: Download the pretrained weights**

```bash
cd Grounded-Segment-Anything

wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
wget https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth
```

We provide two versions of Grounded-SAM demo here:
- [grounded_sam_demo.py](./grounded_sam_demo.py): our original implementation for Grounded-SAM.
- [grounded_sam_simple_demo.py](./grounded_sam_simple_demo.py) our updated more elegant version for Grounded-SAM.

**Step 2: Running original grounded-sam demo**

```python
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python grounded_sam_demo.py \

### :golfing: Grounded-SAM and Inpaint Gradio APP

We support 6 tasks in the local Gradio APPÔºö

1. **scribble**: Segmentation is achieved through Segment Anything and mouse click interaction (you need to click on the object with the mouse, no need to specify the prompt).
2. **automask**: Segment the entire image at once through Segment Anything (no need to specify a prompt).
3. **det**: Realize detection through Grounding DINO and text interaction (text prompt needs to be specified).
4. **seg**: Realize text interaction by combining Grounding DINO and Segment Anything to realize detection + segmentation (need to specify text prompt).
5. **inpainting**: By combining Grounding DINO + Segment Anything + Stable Diffusion to achieve text exchange and replace the target object (need to specify text prompt and inpaint prompt) .
6. **automatic**: By combining BLIP + Grounding DINO + Segment Anything to achieve non-interactive detection + segmentation (no need to specify prompt).

```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

- The gradio_app visualization as follow:

![](./assets/gradio_demo.png)


### :label: Grounded-SAM with RAM or Tag2Text for Automatic Labeling
[**The Recognize Anything Model (RAM) and Tag2Text**](https://github.com/xinyu1205/Recognize_Anything-Tag2Text) exhibits **exceptional recognition abilities**, in terms of **both accuracy and scope**.

It is seamlessly linked to generate pseudo labels automatically as follows:
1. Use RAM/Tag2Text to generate tags.
2. Use Grounded-Segment-Anything to generate the boxes and masks.


**Step 1: Init submodule and download the pretrained checkpoint**

- Init submodule:

```bash
cd Grounded-Segment-Anything
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

- Download pretrained weights for `GroundingDINO`, `SAM` and `RAM/Tag2Text`:

wget https://huggingface.co/spaces/xinyu1205/Tag2Text/resolve/main/tag2text_swin_14m.pth
```

**Step 2: Runing the demo with RAM**
```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python automatic_label_ram_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --ram_checkpoint ./Tag2Text/ram_swin_large_14m.pth \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \
  --input_image assets/demo9.jpg \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --box_threshold 0.25 \
  --text_threshold 0.2 \
  --iou_threshold 0.5 \
  --device "cuda"
```


**Step 2: Or Runing the demo with Tag2Text**
```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python automatic_label_tag2text_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --tag2text_checkpoint ./Tag2Text/tag2text_swin_14m.pth \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \
  --input_image assets/demo9.jpg \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --box_threshold 0.25 \
  --text_threshold 0.2 \
  --iou_threshold 0.5 \
  --device "cuda"
```

- Tag2Text also provides powerful captioning capabilities, and the process with captions can refer to [BLIP](#robot-run-grounded-segment-anything--blip-demo).
- The pseudo labels and model prediction visualization will be saved in `output_dir` as follows (right figure):

![](./assets/automatic_label_output/demo9_tag2text_ram.jpg)


### :robot: Grounded-SAM with BLIP for Automatic Labeling
It is easy to generate pseudo labels automatically as follows:
1. Use BLIP (or other caption models) to generate a caption.
2. Extract tags from the caption. We use ChatGPT to handle the potential complicated sentences. 
3. Use Grounded-Segment-Anything to generate the boxes and masks.

- Run Demo
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://closeai.deno.dev/v1
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python automatic_label_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \
  --input_image assets/demo3.jpg \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --openai_key $OPENAI_API_KEY \
  --box_threshold 0.25 \
  --text_threshold 0.2 \
  --iou_threshold 0.5 \
  --device "cuda"
```

- When you don't have a paid Account for ChatGPT is also possible to use NLTK instead. Just don't include the ```openai_key``` Parameter when starting the Demo.
  - The Script will automatically download the necessary NLTK Data.
- The pseudo labels and model prediction visualization will be saved in `output_dir` as follows:

You can enable chatgpt to help you automatically detect the object and inpainting order with `--enable_chatgpt`. 

Or you can specify the object you want to inpaint [stored in `args.det_speech_file`] and the text you want to inpaint with [stored in `args.inpaint_speech_file`].

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://closeai.deno.dev/v1
# Example: enable chatgpt
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python grounded_sam_whisper_inpainting_demo.py \

Following [Visual ChatGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt), we add a ChatBot for our project. Currently, it supports:
1. "Descripe the image."
2. "Detect the dog (and the cat) in the image."
3. "Segment anything in the image."
4. "Segment the dog (and the cat) in the image."
5. "Help me label the image."
6. "Replace the dog with a cat in the image."

To use the ChatBot:
- Install whisper if you want to use audio as input.
- Set the default model setting in the tool `Grounded_dino_sam_inpainting`.
- Run Demo
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://closeai.deno.dev/v1

  ![](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything/blob/humanFace/assets/231-hair-edit.png)

## :camera: 3D-Box via Segment Anything
We extend the scope to 3D world by combining Segment Anything and [VoxelNeXt](https://github.com/dvlab-research/VoxelNeXt). When we provide a prompt (e.g., a point / box), the result is not only 2D segmentation mask, but also 3D boxes. Please check [voxelnext_3d_box](./voxelnext_3d_box/) for more details.
