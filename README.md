We plan to create a very interesting demo by combining [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) and [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) which aims to detect and segment Anything with text inputs! And we will continue to improve it and create more interesting demos based on this foundation.

We are very willing to **help everyone share and promote new projects** based on Segment-Anything, Please checkout here for more amazing demos and works in the community: [Highlight Extension Projects](#bulb-highlight-extension-projects). You can submit a new issue (with `project` tag) or a new pull request to add new project's links. 

**üçÑ Why Building this Project?**

The **core idea** behind this project is to **combine the strengths of different models in order to build a very powerful pipeline for solving complex problems**. And it's worth mentioning that this is a workflow for combining strong expert models, where **all parts can be used separately or in combination, and can be replaced with any similar but different models (like replacing Grounding DINO with GLIP or other detectors / replacing Stable-Diffusion with ControlNet or GLIGEN/ Combining with ChatGPT)**.

**üçä Preliminary Works**
- [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) is a strong segmentation model. But it needs prompts (like boxes/points) to generate masks. 
- [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) is a strong zero-shot detector which is capable of to generate high quality boxes and labels with free-form text. 
- [OSX](https://osx-ubody.github.io/) is a strong and efficient one-stage motion capture method to generate high quality 3D human mesh from monucular image. We also release a large-scale upper-body dataset UBody for a more accurate reconstrution in the upper-body scene.
- [Stable-Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) is an amazing strong text-to-image diffusion model.
- [BLIP](https://github.com/salesforce/lavis) is a wonderful language-vision model for image understanding.
- [Visual ChatGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt) is a wonderful tool that connects ChatGPT and a series of Visual Foundation Models to enable sending and receiving images during chatting.


**üî• Highlighted Projects** 

- Checkout the [Segment Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://github.com/UX-Decoder/Segment-Everything-Everywhere-All-At-Once) demo! It supports segmenting with various types of prompts (text, point, scribble, referring image, etc.) and any combination of prompts.

## :open_book: Notebook Demo
See our [notebook file](grounded_sam.ipynb) as an example.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

### Install with Docker

Open one terminal:

```
make run
```

That's it.

If you would like to allow visualization across docker container, open another terminal and type:

```
xhost +
```


### Install without Docker

Install Segment Anything:

```bash
python -m pip install -e segment_anything
```

Install Grounding DINO:

```bash
python -m pip install -e GroundingDINO
```


Install diffusers:

```bash
pip install --upgrade diffusers[torch]
```

Install osx:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd grounded-sam-osx && bash install.sh
```

The following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format, the example notebooks, and exporting the model in ONNX format. `jupyter` is also required to run the example notebooks.

```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx ipykernel
```

More details can be found in [install segment anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#installation) and [install GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO#install) and [install OSX](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/OSX)

## :speech_balloon: Run ChatBot Demo
Following [Visual ChatGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt), we add a ChatBot for our project. Currently, it supports:
1. "Descripe the image."
2. "Detect the dog (and the cat) in the image."
3. "Segment anything in the image."
4. "Segment the dog (and the cat) in the image."
5. "Help me label the image."
6. "Replace the dog with a cat in the image."

To use the ChatBot:
- Install whisper if you want to use audio as input.
- Set the default model setting in the tool `Grounded_dino_sam_inpainting`.
- Run Demo
```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python chatbot.py
