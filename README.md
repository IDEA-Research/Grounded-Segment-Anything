# Grounded-Segment-Anything
We plan to create a very interesting demo by combining [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) and [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)! Right now, this is just a simple small project. We will continue to improve it and create more interesting demos. And thanks for the community users provide the [colab demo](https://github.com/camenduru/grounded-segment-anything-colab) for us.

We are very willing to **help everyone share and promote new projects** based on Segment-Anything, we highlight some excellent projects here: [Highlight Extension Projects](#bulb-highlight-extension-projects). You can submit a new issue (with `project` tag) or a new pull request to add new projects' links.

**Why this project?**

The **core idea** behind this project is to **combine the strengths of different models in order to build a very powerful pipeline for solving complex problems**. And it's worth mentioning that this is a workflow for combining strong expert models, where **all parts can be used separately or in combination, and can be replaced with any similar but different models (like replacing Grounding DINO with GLIP or other detectors / replacing Stable-Diffusion with ControlNet or GLIGEN/ Combining with ChatGPT)**.

- [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) is a strong segmentation model. But it needs prompts (like boxes/points) to generate masks. 
- [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) is a strong zero-shot detector which is capable of to generate high quality boxes and labels with free-form text. 
- The combination of `Grounding DINO + SAM` enable to **detect and segment everything at any levels** with text inputs!
- The combination of `BLIP + Grounding DINO + SAM` for **automatic labeling system**!
- The combination of `Grounding DINO + SAM + Stable-diffusion` for **data-factory, generating new data**!
- The combination of `Whisper + Grounding DINO + SAM` to **detect and segment anything with speech**!

**Grounded-SAM + Stable-Diffusion Inpainting: Data-Factory, Generating New Data!**

**BLIP + Grounded-SAM: Automatic Label System!**

Using BLIP to generate caption, extract tags and using Grounded-SAM for box and mask generating. Here's the demo output:

**Imagine Space**

Some possible avenues for future work ...
- Automatic image generation to construct new datasets.
- Stronger foundation models with segmentation pre-training.
- Collaboration with (Chat-)GPT.
- A whole pipeline to automatically label image (with box and mask) and generate new image.

**More Examples**

**Tips**
- If you want to detect multiple objects in one sentence with [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO), we suggest seperating each name with `.` . An example: `cat . dog . chair .`

## :fire: What's New 
- ðŸ†• Release the interactive fashion-edit playground in [here](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything/tree/humanFace). Run in the notebook, just click for annotating points for further segmentation. Enjoy it!

## :open_book: Notebook Demo
See our [notebook file](grounded_sam.ipynb) as an example.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

Install Segment Anything:

```bash
python -m pip install -e segment_anything
```

Install Grounding DINO:

```bash
python -m pip install -e GroundingDINO
```


Install diffusers:

```bash
pip install --upgrade diffusers[torch]
```


The following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format, the example notebooks, and exporting the model in ONNX format. `jupyter` is also required to run the example notebooks.
```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx ipykernel
```

More details can be found in [install segment anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#installation) and [install GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO#install)

**Run Voice-to-inpaint Demo**

You can enable chatgpt to help you automatically detect the object and inpainting order with `--enable_chatgpt`. 

Or you can specify the object you want to inpaint [stored in `args.det_speech_file`] and the text you want to inpaint with [stored in `args.inpaint_speech_file`].

```bash
# Example: enable chatgpt
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
export OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_key
python grounded_sam_whisper_inpainting_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \

  --prompt_speech_file assets/acoustics/prompt_speech_file.mp3 \
  --enable_chatgpt \
  --openai_key $OPENAI_KEY \
  --device "cuda"
```

```bash
# Example: without chatgpt
