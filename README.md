We plan to create a very interesting demo by combining [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) and [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) which aims to detect and segment Anything with text inputs! And we will continue to improve it and create more interesting demos based on this foundation.

We are very willing to **help everyone share and promote new projects** based on Segment-Anything, Please checkout here for more amazing demos and works in the community: [Highlight Extension Projects](#bulb-highlight-extension-projects). You can submit a new issue (with `project` tag) or a new pull request to add new project's links. 

**üçÑ Why Building this Project?**

The **core idea** behind this project is to **combine the strengths of different models in order to build a very powerful pipeline for solving complex problems**. And it's worth mentioning that this is a workflow for combining strong expert models, where **all parts can be used separately or in combination, and can be replaced with any similar but different models (like replacing Grounding DINO with GLIP or other detectors / replacing Stable-Diffusion with ControlNet or GLIGEN/ Combining with ChatGPT)**.

**üçä Preliminary Works**
- [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) is a strong segmentation model. But it needs prompts (like boxes/points) to generate masks. 
- [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) is a strong zero-shot detector which is capable of to generate high quality boxes and labels with free-form text. 
- [OSX](https://osx-ubody.github.io/) is a strong and efficient one-stage motion capture method to generate high quality 3D human mesh from monucular image. We also release a large-scale upper-body dataset UBody for a more accurate reconstrution in the upper-body scene.
- [Stable-Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) is an amazing strong text-to-image diffusion model.
- [BLIP](https://github.com/salesforce/lavis) is a wonderful language-vision model for image understanding.
- [Visual ChatGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt) is a wonderful tool that connects ChatGPT and a series of Visual Foundation Models to enable sending and receiving images during chatting.
- [VoxelNeXt](https://github.com/dvlab-research/VoxelNeXt) is a clean, simple, and fully-sparse 3D object detector, which predicts objects directly upon sparse voxel features.

## :open_book: Notebook Demo
See our [notebook file](grounded_sam.ipynb) as an example.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

### Install with Docker

Open one terminal:

```
make run
```

That's it.

If you would like to allow visualization across docker container, open another terminal and type:

```
xhost +
```


### Install without Docker

Install Segment Anything:

```bash
python -m pip install -e segment_anything
```

Install Grounding DINO:

```bash
python -m pip install -e GroundingDINO
```


Install diffusers:

```bash
pip install --upgrade diffusers[torch]
```

Install osx:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd grounded-sam-osx && bash install.sh
```

The following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format, the example notebooks, and exporting the model in ONNX format. `jupyter` is also required to run the example notebooks.

```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx ipykernel
```

More details can be found in [install segment anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#installation) and [install GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO#install) and [install OSX](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/OSX)

```

- The gradio_app visualization as follow:

![](./assets/gradio_demo.png)


## :robot: Run Grounded-Segment-Anything + BLIP Demo
It is easy to generate pseudo labels automatically as follows:
1. Use BLIP (or other caption models) to generate a caption.
2. Extract tags from the caption. We use ChatGPT to handle the potential complicated sentences. 
3. Use Grounded-Segment-Anything to generate the boxes and masks.

- Run Demo
```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python automatic_label_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \
  --input_image assets/demo3.jpg \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --openai_key your_openai_key \
  --box_threshold 0.25 \
  --text_threshold 0.2 \
  --iou_threshold 0.5 \
  --device "cuda"
```

- When you don't have a paid Account for ChatGPT is also possible to use NLTK instead. Just don't include the ```openai_key``` Parameter when starting the Demo.
  - The Script will automatically download the necessary NLTK Data.
- The pseudo labels and model prediction visualization will be saved in `output_dir` as follows:

**Run Voice-to-inpaint Demo**

You can enable chatgpt to help you automatically detect the object and inpainting order with `--enable_chatgpt`. 

Or you can specify the object you want to inpaint [stored in `args.det_speech_file`] and the text you want to inpaint with [stored in `args.inpaint_speech_file`].

```bash
# Example: enable chatgpt
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
export OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_key
python grounded_sam_whisper_inpainting_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \
